# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
# ===================================================
#
# This configuration is for LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY
# DO NOT use this in production environments!
#
# This file uses "trust" authentication for all connections,
# which allows passwordless access from any source.
# This is necessary for WSL→Docker connections where the source
# IP is not recognized as localhost (127.0.0.1).
#
# For production, use scram-sha-256 or other secure authentication methods.

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     trust

# Allow all IPv4 connections with trust authentication
# This enables WSL, Docker, and localhost connections without password
host    all             all             all                     trust

# Replication connections
local   replication     all                                     trust
host    replication     all             all                     trust
